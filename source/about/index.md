**Who I am**
My name is Hieda no Ajuu (稗田 阿柔), also written as Ajuu Hieda. 

The name is inspired by [Hieda no Akyuu](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Hieda_no_Akyuu) (稗田 阿求), my favorite character from [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project) series. She is a chronicler and historian who preserves the memories of Gensokyo—a figure who embodies remembrance, continuity, and legacy.

**My Journey in Computer Science**
My journey in computer science began early, fueled by curiosity about electricity that started in kindergarten. In 4th grade, I first encountered programming through [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), fascinated by blinking LEDs and simple circuits. Wiring transistors, however, was tricky for me,  so I moved on to software the next year. My first programming language was [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Today, I primarily write programs in [C](https://www.c-language.org) for its efficiency and low-level control. I am also planning to learn [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) to explore modern systems programming concepts.

**What You’ll Find Here**
This site is a space where I freely explore my passions:

- 🎮 **Touhou Project Fanworks** — Dive into my stories and creations inspired by the Touhou universe as well as real-world experiences.
- 📜 **Translations of History & Literature** — Explore history and culture through my translations of historical and literary texts.
- 💻 **Computer Science Notes** — Read my study notes on programming, computer science, and free/libre and open source software.

The blog is built with [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) using [NexT](https://theme-next.js.org/) theme and deployed on [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). 

I first launched the site in 2023, and rebuilt it in 2025 to focus on writing in English, aiming to reach a wider audience. I also secured the domain name [ajuu.org](https://ajuu.org) for it.
