Subject: Feedback on iOS DRM and software freedom

Dear Mr. Cook,

I used to be an iPad user and have appreciated Apple's efforts in GUI
and UX design.

However, I'm concerned about Apple's use of DRM on iOS. Apple retains
unilateral control over software distribution. While Alternative app
distribution exists, it remains constrained. This is not a matter of
convenience or competition, but of who ultimately controls the user's
device.

I will not purchase or support any Apple devices until this changes. I
hope Apple listens to the voices of the customers like me and works to
eliminating DRM from all your devices.

Faithfully,
Ajuu Hieda
