    <title>Flandre in Flanders</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>The rain of the fifth month after Christmas had just stopped. I, the earliest to rise, leaned on the edge of the trench, greedily breathing in the air.</p>
<p>I saw the poppies in bloom.</p>
<p>The rain had washed away the chlorotic fog. Rising from the deep gray earth—were the poppies truly that scarlet?</p>
<p>A maiden in red and white, golden hair floating in the pale wind.</p>
<p>“Flandre,” I called her.</p>
<p>I had seen her dance, ignoring the mud of the field. Her steps grew wilder with the falling raindrops, and in an instant, she dissolved into the rain.</p>
<p>She looked at me, her iridescent wings slowly spreading.</p>
<p>I wanted to touch her wings, even if it cost me my life—and only the latter came true.</p>

    <title>A Lane in Rain</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>By <strong>Dai Wangshu</strong><br>Translated by <strong>Ajuu Hieda</strong></p>
<p>Beneath an oiled-paper umbrella, I linger<br>Down a long and lonely lane.<br>I long to meet once more<br>The lilac maiden sighing in the rain.</p>
<p>With lilac’s color,<br>Lilac’s fragrance,<br>Lilac’s <em>tristesse</em>,<br>Her sorrow whispers.</p>
<p>She drifts along the lane,<br>Umbrella in her hand.<br>Silent steps echo mine.<br>As if we share the same gloom.</p>
<p>In stillness, she approaches,<br>Casting a sighing glance at my way.</p>
<p>She drifts past,<br>A mere dream in the mist.</p>
<p>As a petal floats past the dream,<br>She drifts past me, fading away,<br>Toward the ruined fence<br>And the alley in the rain. </p>
<p>Amid the blue notes of rain,<br>Her color, her fragrance fade,<br>Even the lilac’s <em>tristesse</em><br>Gone with her sighing glance.</p>
<p>Beneath an oiled-paper umbrella, I linger<br>Down a long and lonely lane.<br>I long to meet once more<br>The lilac maiden gliding through my faint dream.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rhythm of a poem lies not in the words themselves, but in the emotion they convey.</p>
<p>Strict rhythm and forced words can spoil the emotion, rendering it unnatural. It is as if putting oneself in someone else’s shoes, bending emotion to rigid and shallow rules. The inferior mutilate themselves to fit the shoes (a Chinese metaphor for acting in a Procrustean way). The clever choose the pair that fits. The wise craft their own to their measure.</p>
<p>Modern Chinese Poetry needs to have new emotions to express and suitable techniques of expression. Techniques do not mean arranging words superficially or stuffing a poem with ornate phrases.</p>

    <title>The Spring</title>
    <url>/2025/09/20/spring/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>By <strong>Mu Dan</strong><br>Translated by <strong>Ajuu Hieda</strong></p>
<p>Green flames flicker across the grass,<br>As if longing to embrace the flowers.<br>Flowers stretch upward, against the earth.<br>When warm wind stirs both joy and fret,<br>You wake and fling the windows open to the air.<br>The garden brims with desires, all uncannily fair.</p>
<p>In their twenties, bodies tremble before unending riddles,<br>As if birdsongs rise from the earth.<br>You are ignited, yet belong nowhere.<br>Ah — the light, the shadow, the voice, the colors — all laid bare,<br>They ache, awaiting a new communion.</p>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mu Dan was a thoughtful man, fully aware of his identity as a modern intellectual. He pondered deeply on life, probing the joy and pain inside the soul. Yet he could condense his reflections into a few lines, achieving remarkable expressive power.</p>
<p><em>— Excerpt from Du Yunxie, Recalling Mu Dan, translated by Ajuu Hieda.</em></p>
