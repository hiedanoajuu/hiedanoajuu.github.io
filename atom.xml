Apple retainsunilateral control over software distribution. While Alternative appdistribution exists, it remains constrained. This is not a matter ofconvenience or competition, but of who ultimately controls the user'sdevice.I will not purchase or support any Apple devices until this changes. Ihope Apple listens to the voices of the customers like me and works toeliminating DRM from all your devices.Faithfully,Ajuu Hieda</pre>]]></content>

He pondered deeply on life, probing the joy and pain inside the soul. Yet he could condense his reflections into a few lines, achieving remarkable expressive power.</p><p><em>—Excerpt from Du Yunxie, Recalling Mu Dan, translated by Ajuu Hieda.</em></p></blockquote>]]></content>

It is as if putting oneself in someone else’s shoes, bending emotion to rigid and shallow rules. The inferior mutilate themselves to fit the shoes (a Chinese metaphor for acting in a Procrustean way). The clever choose the pair that fits. The wise craft their own to their measure.</p><p>Modern Chinese Poetry needs to have new emotions to express and suitable techniques of expression. Techniques do not mean arranging words superficially or stuffing a poem with ornate phrases.</p><p><em>—Excerpt from Dai Wanshu, Poetics, translated by Ajuu Hieda.</em></p></blockquote>]]></content>
