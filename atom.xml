    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“The W3C has a duty to send the DRM-peddlers packing, just as the US courts did in the case of digital TV. There is no market for DRM, no public purpose served by granting a veto to unaccountable, shortsighted media giants who dream of a world where your mouse rings a cash-register with every click and disruption is something that happens to other people, not them.”<br>―<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2013/mar/12/tim-berners-lee-drm-cory-doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a></p><p>“W3C is there to create comprehensible, publicly-implementable standards that will guarantee interoperability, not to facilitate an explosion of new mutually-incompatible software and of sites and services that can only be accessed by particular devices or applications. But EME is a proposal to bring exactly that dysfunctional dynamic into HTML5, even risking a return to the “bad old days, before the Web” of deliberately limited interoperability.”<br>―<a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/03/defend-open-web-keep-drm-out-w3c-standards">Peter Eckersley and Seth Schoen of the Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></p></blockquote><p><img src="hollyweb.jpeg" alt="Hollyweb" title="Hollyweb"></p><p><em>Please share the Hollyweb image, which is copyright Free Software Foundation 2013, under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license</a>.</em></p>]]></content>

Apple retainsunilateral control over software distribution. While Alternative appdistribution exists, it remains constrained. This is not a matter ofconvenience or competition, but of who ultimately controls the user'sdevice.I will not purchase or support any Apple devices until this changes. Ihope Apple listens to the voices of the customers like me and works toeliminating DRM from all your devices.Faithfully,Ajuu Hieda</pre>]]></content>

The wise craft their own to their measure.</p><p>Modern Chinese Poetry needs to have new emotions to express and suitable techniques of expression.
